HomeWatcher Change Log:

*2012-03-20:
1. When logged in, hitting the back button and exiting the app 
now explicitly signs off the user from the panel. This prevents 
the user from returning to the app later, unable to log on
because the socket is still open. If the user leaves the app 
running, the connection will remain active, only when the 
back button is hit is logout automatic.
2. Yellow sign-on icon appears as user is logging in, but before 
the system has confirmed the login. 
3. Indeterminate progress bar appears when user is logging in.
4. Indeterminate progress bar appears near the panel LEDs on 
the Status tab when the LED information is being loaded after 
signing on.
5. Checksums on messages received back from the server are 
now verified.
